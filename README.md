# Resource Index (res-index)

A searchable index for development resources, including github repo and npm packages.

Hosted on [res-index.hkit.cc](https://res-index.hkit.cc/)

## Why yet another index?

**In short, the search functionality on google and github are unsatisfied. This project aim to build a better alternative and potentially improve google's search result.**

Sometime I want to search for a npm package but google cannot return that result even after I added "npm", "github", or even the combination of exact author username and package name.

Similarly, it's sometime hopeless to search for a non-popular package by name on github if you cannot recall the author's username.

Sometime google can not show the corresponding npm page but instead shows it on "socket.dev" or "snyk.io".

Pasting the exact npm url in subsequence search doesn't seem effective at hinting google to index the pages.

This project aim to actively index some github repositories and npm packages to enable more inclusive searching.

In addition, this project try be SEO-friendly. Hopefully, it can improve google's search result overtime.
